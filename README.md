## Overview
This game spawns in nine different colours onto a grid of eighteen. This means that every colour has one matching tile. The goal of the game is to match all the colours with their shared colour tile before the timer runs out. If you match all the coloured tiles before the timer runs out, you win! Otherwise, you always have the opportunity to restart!
